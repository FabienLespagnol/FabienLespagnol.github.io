About me
-

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at IMAG (Institut Mathématiques Alexander Grothendieck), where my research focuses on the analysis of partial differential equations for multi-fluid flows, with a particular emphasis on compressible Navier-Stokes equations for the modeling and simulation of bubbly flows.

I completed my PhD under a joint supervision program between Politecnico di Milano and Inria Paris. My work involved the modeling, mathematical analysis, and finite element resolution of problems involving slender structures immersed in three-dimensional fluid.
